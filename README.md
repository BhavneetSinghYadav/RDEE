# Recursive Dynamical Existence Engine (RDEE)

---

**A Modular Scientific Simulation Platform for Recursive Conditional Existence Filtering**

---

## Project Summary

RDEE models the recursive emergence, filtering, survival, and collapse of complex existence systems across layered ontologies:

- Cosmological substrate generation
- Planetary formation filtering
- Chemical emergence probabilities
- Biological evolutionary fragilities
- Recursive meta-conditional survival chains

The engine is designed for controlled high-dimensional simulations of existence-phase space topologies.

This repository implements the full simulation core, recursive bifurcation models, parameter expansion, sampling architecture, storage pipeline, monitoring, and visualization layers — all under strict epistemic build protocols.

## Current System State (v1.1 Stabilization Phase)

- ✅ Full module decomposition implemented
- ✅ Interface layer schema established
- ✅ Physical & sanity validation layers operational
- ✅ Sampling layer bootstrapped (uniform random)
- ✅ Monitoring layer initialized
- ✅ Data pipeline implemented (HDF5)
- ✅ Visualization layer initialized (survival heatmaps)
- ✅ Full epistemic build protocols encoded in AGENTS.md
- ✅ Epistemic safety patches applied (shared defaults fixed)

---

## Repository Structure

- `interface/` — Parameter schemas, user input, sweep expansion
- `validation/` — Physics constraints, sanity checks, master validator
- `sampling/` — Sampling controllers and future adaptive samplers
- `storage/` — Storage pipeline (HDF5 persistence)
- `monitoring/` — Runtime state monitoring
- `visualization/` — Existence heatmap generators
- `simulation_engine/core/` — (Scaffolded, recursion engine to follow)
- `orchestration/` — (Scaffolded, simulation orchestration to follow)
- `tests/` — Full test suite (in construction)

---

## Epistemic Build Contracts

- All build protocols strictly governed via:
  - `AGENTS.md` (architectural rules, file boundaries, library controls)
  - `MODULE_EXTENSION.md` (extension protocols)
  - `PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md` (parameter set definitions)

- All module builds are conducted via controlled bounded Codex agents, under isolated file scopes.

- All unit tests are being constructed under formalized `Test Build Kit v1.0`.

---

## Current Limitations

- No recursion core integrated yet (planned Phase 2)
- No adaptive sampling logic yet
- No full orchestration layer yet
- No cluster-scale posterior integrations yet

---

## Immediate Roadmap

- ✅ Complete full unit test suite (Test Build Kit v1.0)
- ✅ Lock recursion core safety protocols
- ✅ Begin recursive bifurcation engine implementation
- ✅ Launch controlled orchestration layer
- ✅ Extend visualization pipeline into survival topology maps

---

## System Build Philosophy

RDEE is designed for:

- Recursive epistemic safety
- Strict modular isolation
- Controlled build determinism
- Scientific reproducibility

---

## Licensing

Currently in private research development phase under controlled access.

---

## Collaboration

This repository is under controlled epistemic development.  
Collaborations may be considered post-stabilization of recursion core.
