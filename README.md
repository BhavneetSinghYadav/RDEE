# Recursive Dynamical Existence Engine (RDEE)

---

**Phase: v1.1 — Recursive Engine Lockpoint Achieved**

---

## Project Summary

RDEE models the recursive conditional survival, collapse, and bifurcation of existence regimes across layered ontologies of emergence:

- Cosmological constants
- Stellar formation filters
- Planetary viability constraints
- Prebiotic chemical conditions
- Evolutionary fragility thresholds

The system operates as a modular epistemically-controlled scientific existence simulation framework.

## System Build Philosophy

- Modular recursive epistemic safety
- Strict file-boundary isolation
- Full scientific reproducibility
- Controlled Codex build agent execution
- Zero speculative automation; all extensions are epistemically verified

---

## Current Limitations (Pre-Orchestration Phase)

- No full orchestration layer yet
- No batch-scale parameter sweep controller
- No adaptive sampling or survival-density prioritization
- No existence phase-space sensitivity amplification yet
- No dynamic parameter entanglement modeling yet

---

## Next Immediate Development Phase

**RDEE Build Kit v3.0 — Orchestration Layer Deployment**

- Central simulation run manager
- Batch control pipeline
- Parallelization hooks for multiple recursive runs
- Storage linkage to persistent trace archive
- Prepare adaptive sampling for Build Kit v4.0

## Licensing

Currently in private controlled research development.

## Collaboration

Collaboration requests may be considered after Phase 3 system stabilization is achieved.
